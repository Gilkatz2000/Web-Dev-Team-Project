            <div class="comment1"> What a cool experience! My young adult daughter and I were only here for one day but we managed to even out our time at the water park and at the theme park. We visited July 19,2019. I was pleasantly surprised that the park wasn't super packed. There were some really cool roller coasters. We only rode a couple and my favorite was the Superman. We have Six Flags memberships so we are able to visit other parks at no additional cost. This was a bonus perk :). So if you are considering going but are a little hesitant... let me reassure you it will be worth the trip. We had a great time and stayed almost the entire day. Next time we're back in San Antonio, I know Six Flags will be on the to do list.</div>
